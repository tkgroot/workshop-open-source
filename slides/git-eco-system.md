# How the open-source software eco-system works

- Platforms for collaboration
  - [Github](https://github.com/)
  - [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com), [about Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
    - [public instance Tor project](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo)
    - [public instance of Castopod](https://code.podlibre.org/podlibre/castopod-host)
  - [Gitea](https://gitea.com/)
  - [Codeberg e.V.](https://codeberg.org/)
  - Azure DevOps
  - AWS CodeCommit
- all platforms use GIT as version control system

<!--
Software contributions aren't limited to one centralized place. Although Github has some kind of monopoly on this market as the biggest platform, containing an sheer unlimited amount of open-source projects, it is not the only place where you can contribute to open-source software.

Some software projects host their own instance of Gitlab or Gitea to provide an independent platform for their code. Why is that necessary or needed you might ask. It's a general problem of centralisation, where the centralised entity can control and dictate its behaviour. A known issue where github was or is not available or ristricted its acess in countries which face or have active US sanctions or trade-bans.

Good examples of such an public instance is the tor project's own gitlab instance, and castopod an podcasting tool.

A further good example is Codeberg e.V. a non-profit association which is home to many open-source projects, like tracktor, an offline GDPR complaint generator against web-tracking. It it build upon Gitea.

All platforms use git as version control system, which itself is free and open-source.
