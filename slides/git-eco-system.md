# How the open-source software eco-system works

- Platforms for collaboration
  - [Github](https://github.com/)
  - [Gitlab]()
    - [public instance Tor project]()
    - [different project]()
  - [Gitea](https://gitea.com/)
  - [Codeberg e.V.](https://codeberg.org/)
  - Azure DevOps
  - AWS CodeCommit
- all platforms use GIT as version control system

<!--
Software contributions aren't limited to one centralized place. Although Github has some kind of monopoly on this market as the biggest platform, containing an sheer unlimited amount of open-source projects, it is not the only place where you can contribute to open-source software.

Some software projects host their own instance of Gitlab or Gitea to provide an independent platform for their code. (known issue of github not being available in countries prohibited by US law).

Good examples are the tor project's own gitlab instance, and thing

A further good example is Codeberg e.V. a non-profit association which is home to many open-source projects, like tracktor, an offline GDPR complaint generator against web-tracking.

All platforms use git as version control system, which itself is free and open-source.
